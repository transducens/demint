This omission impacts the grammatical structure and flow by not properly connecting the ideas within the sentence. The conjunction is needed to properly link the speaker's acknowledgment of hearing about the subject with the relayed opinion that it is \"pretty good.\" Without a proper conjunction, the sentence reads disjointedly.\n\n\n\n **Do you want to practice this error?**"
