Specifically, the phrase \"just a taste\" should include a definite article to indicate that a specific, limited quantity of something is being referred to. In English, when discussing a singular, countable noun, a definite article such as \"a\" or \"an\" is typically needed to clarify the specificity and singularity of the noun in question. This helps in distinguishing that you are talking about a particular, discrete amount or instance—like having just one sample of food to understand its popularity or appeal. By missing this article, the sentence loses a bit of clarity and formal correctness, which is particularly important in written communication.\n\n **What do you want to do next?**"
