The subjects \"written letters and postcards\" form a plural noun phrase, which requires a plural verb for correct grammatical agreement.

This mismatch between the plural subject and the singular verb violates the basic grammatical rule that a plural subject must have a plural verb. Hence, the correct form of the verb should align with the plurality of the subject to ensure proper agreement.\n\n **Do you want an extensive explanation of the English grammar of this case?**"

This principle ensures clarity and coherence in sentence structure. Let's delve into the rules and some common issues related to subject-verb agreement.\n\n### Basic Rules of Subject-Verb Agreement\n\n1. **Singular Subjects with Singular Verbs:** When the subject of the sentence is singular, the verb must also be singular. For example:\n   - *The cat **runs** fast.*\n   - In this sentence, 'cat' is a singular subject, and 'runs' is the corresponding singular verb form.\n\n2. **Plural Subjects with Plural Verbs:** When the subject is plural, the verb must be plural. For example:\n   - *The children **play** in the park.*\n   - Here, 'children' is a plural subject, requiring 'play,' which is the plural form of the verb.\n\n### Identifying the Subject"
