1. Main Branches:
    - 'master':  The primary branch containing the production version of the product, available to users.
    - 'develop': The development branch that holds all the latest changes for upcoming releases.

2. Support Branches:
    - 'Feature branches (feature/)': Created from the 'develop' branch for developing new features. Once the feature is complete, the branch is merged back into 'develop'.

3. Merge Rules:
    -  Before creating a pull request, it is mandatory to squash all commits to keep the history clean.
    -  Always update from the 'develop' branch before making a pull request to ensure that the 'feature' branch is up-to-date with the latest changes.
    -  After finishing in the feature branch, a pull request should be made to the appropriate target branch ('develop'). This facilitates code review before merging.

4. Usage Recommendations:
    - Before starting significant changes or new features, update the 'develop' branch from 'master' to include all recent fixes and changes.
    - Developers should frequently update their local 'develop' and 'feature' branches from the main 'develop' branch to avoid conflicts during merging.
    - It is recommended to use a visual interface, such as Docker Desktop, for managing Git operations. This approach can help visualize branch structures and streamline Git workflows.
