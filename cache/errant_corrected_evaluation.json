These problems\nwith sentence construction confuse your readers and obscure your meaning. Their use will\nalso result in clumsy, unpolished writing and speech. Let’s look at each of these sentence\nerrors in detail so that you’ll be able to fix them with ease.\nAs you’ve learned, there are two types of clauses: independent and dependent.\nG Independent clauses are complete sentences because they have a subject, a verb, and\nexpress a complete thought.\nI go to the movies every Saturday night.\nRichard Nixon’s favorite drink was a dry martini.\nG Dependent clauses cannot stand alone because they do not express a complete thought,\neven though they have a subject and a verb.\nSince\nI\nenjoy the movies.\nsubject. verb\nBecause Richard Nixon’s favorite \ndrink \nwas a dry martini.\nsubject. verb\nA run-on sentence is two incorrectly joined independent clauses. A comma splice is a run-\non sentence with a comma where the two independent clauses run together. When your sen-\ntences run together, your ideas are garbled.\nRun-on: Our eyes are always the same size from birth our nose and ears never stop growing."

Problems with subject-verb agreement\nIncorrect: Verbs has to agree with their subjects.\nCorrect:\nVerbs have to agree with their subjects.\nAgreement means that sentence parts match, singular to singular and plural to plural.\nSince the subject verbs is plural, it takes a plural verb, agree.\nThis is confusing because we add -s or -es to make the third-person singular form of most\nverbs but add -s or -es to make the plural form of most nouns. For example, he starts is sin-\ngular, but six papers is plural. Both end in s. Agreement is covered in detail in Chapter 5.\n4. Lack of parallel structure\nNot parallel: To avoid getting hit by lightning, never seek protection under a tree, lying\ndown on wet ground, or staying on a bike.\nParallel: To avoid getting hit by lightning, never seek protection under a tree, lie down\non wet ground, or stay on a bike.\nParallel structure means putting ideas of the same rank in the same grammatical struc-\nture. Your writing (and speech) should have parallel words, phrases, and clauses.\nG Parallel words share the same part of speech (such as nouns, adjectives, or verbs) and\ntense (if the words are verbs).\nG Parallel phrases create an underlying rhythm in your speech and writing."

These problems\nwith sentence construction confuse your readers and obscure your meaning. Their use will\nalso result in clumsy, unpolished writing and speech. Let’s look at each of these sentence\nerrors in detail so that you’ll be able to fix them with ease.\nAs you’ve learned, there are two types of clauses: independent and dependent.\nG Independent clauses are complete sentences because they have a subject, a verb, and\nexpress a complete thought.\nI go to the movies every Saturday night.\nRichard Nixon’s favorite drink was a dry martini.\nG Dependent clauses cannot stand alone because they do not express a complete thought,\neven though they have a subject and a verb.\nSince\nI\nenjoy the movies.\nsubject. verb\nBecause Richard Nixon’s favorite \ndrink \nwas a dry martini.\nsubject. verb\nA run-on sentence is two incorrectly joined independent clauses. A comma splice is a run-\non sentence with a comma where the two independent clauses run together.
