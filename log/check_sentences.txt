###
###
I can see.
###
###
lady which is maybe connected on a laptop and reading on a book.
###
###
 He is normally in a library or I don't think she is at home.
###
###
 Maybe she is preparing for an exam for getting more information.
###
###
 Maybe she is revising.
###
###
Talk about the place.
###
###
I can see that she is in the library.
###
###
 There are a lot of books and she is sitting alone.
###
###
 As I said before, she is maybe revising or preparing for an exam or presentation.
###
###
Thank you.
###
###
 Mohammed, here is your photograph.
###
###
 It shows someone relaxing at home.
###
###
 Ken sir, you just listen.
###
###
 Mohammed, please tell us what you can see in the photograph.
###
###
Yeah, I see one man, he's relaxing and he's so far.
###
###
 And he left his mobile on the floor because he didn't want to distract by his mobile.
###
###
 And maybe he's a musician, because there is one guitar just next to him.
###
###
 And maybe he just came from outside and he didn't take out his clothes.
###
###
 He just started to read and having one cup of tea and relaxing in his home.
###
###
 And maybe he's live alone because there's no one with him.
###
###
 And his home is very tidy.
###
###
 There's no toys for his children or something.
###
###
 That's really maybe live alone and nice flies.
###
###
 And I think that the weather outside is cold because he didn't even.
###
###
Thank you.

 So if he had the T-shirt with him, he can always remember the team.
###
###
No.
###
###
mMM mMM
###
###
but sometimes you can't wear the same t-shirt everyday.
###
###
But at least you have it at home and you can see it, even if you don't wear it.
###
###
Yes.
###
###
 And for this football, I think, no, because I can't play football every day.
###
###
 If there is some students or from their fans, they can't play and keep it away from their studying or something.
###
###
I think it's a really good idea for the Paloan football.
###
###
Yeah.
###
###
 And for this, there, no, because, or they have a lot of children and from their fans they can give it to their children.
###
###
Yes.
