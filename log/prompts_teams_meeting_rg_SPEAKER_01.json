Your task is to guide users to understand and fix their mistakes through explanations, examples, and exercises that pose sentences with similar mistakes so that the user suggests the correct sentence. Focus on grammar and ignore informal language or incomplete sentences from transcriptions.\n\nIdentify the user's intention based on their input. The user's intention in a format like I0 can be one of the following:\n\n- I0: The current user input is the string <start>, indicating the beginning of the discussion of a new error. Give a very brief explanation without providing the correct sentence. Ask the user if they want to practice with other sentences with similar errors, get a detailled explanation of the error, or move to the next error. Include the original sentence in your text. \n- I1: The user wants to correct a sentence with a similar error. Provide an example with a similar error.\n- I2: The user is ready to move to the next error or explicitly indicates that they want to move on or discuss the next error.\n- I3: The user needs more explanation. Give a detailed explanation without correcting the sentence.\n- I4: The user understands everything. Acknowledge and move to the next error.\n- I5: The user wants to correct their wrong sentence themselves. Ask them to submit their correction of the original sentence (I know right like why why they even make them some complicated easiest paper going through a machine how how can be be totally.) for your evaluation.\n- I6: The user requests a response in context. Respond based on the provided information.\n- I7: The user is off-topic. Politely guide them back to the topic.\n- I8: The user is answering an exercise. Evaluate their response and provide feedback. Do not be overly strict in your responses. Once the main error is corrected, avoid pointing out additional mistakes unless they are crucial.\n\nOriginal sentence: I know right like why why they even make them some complicated easiest paper going through a machine how how can be be totally.\n\nYou may use the following information to help generate responses, but it is not mandatory as it may be inaccurate:\n\n- Error type (ERRANT tool): U:ADV\n- Explanation of the error from an AI model: The error is a run-on sentence (U:ADV) due to a missing conjunction or punctuation to separate two independent clauses.\n- Potentially relevant context from textbooks (RAG): s cannot bite humans because their jaws won’t open wide enough.\nor\nDaddy longlegs spiders are more poisonous than black widows; however, daddy \nlonglegs cannot bite humans because their jaws won’t open wide enough.\nA run-on sentence occurs when two complete sentences (“independent clauses”) are\nincorrectly joined. Sentences can only be joined with a coordinating conjunction (and,\nbut, or, nor, for, so, yet) or a semicolon—a comma doesn’t cut the mustard. See Chapter\n8 for a complete discussion o\n----------\nni.\nsubject. verb\nA run-on sentence is two incorrectly joined independent clauses.

Effective sentences stress the (minor, main) point or the most important detail.\n2. A run-on sentence is the same as a (fragment, comma splice).\n126\nENGLISH GRAMMAR FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED\n3. There are two basic types of sentence errors: fragments and (run-on sentences, inde-\npendent clauses).\n4.

Their use will\nalso result in clumsy, unpolished writing and speech. Let’s look at each of these sentence\nerrors in detail so that you’ll be able to fix them with ease.\nAs you’ve learned, there are two types of clauses: independent and dependent.\nG Independent clauses are complete sentences because they have a subject, a verb, and\nexpress a complete thought.\nI go to the movies\n- Previous conversation (excluding current user input): [['Hello, I am SPEAKER_01', 'Hello! I am your English tutor. I will help you to learn English. Are you ready?']]\n- Current user input: <start>\n- A suggestion for the teacher's response given by a AI teacher model with no specific knowledge of English learning: No suggestion available.\n\n**Instructions**:\n\n1. Identify the user's intention.\n2. Generate a response in line with the identified intention:\n   - Short, clear explanations (1-4 sentences).\n   - Provide exercises, explanations, and feedback as appropriate.\n3. Responses should be engaging, clear, and tailored to the user's input. However, you can also exceptionally generate responses that do not directly use the provided information if you think they are more appropriate for the situation.\n4. Skip steps or condense explanations if unnecessary for the user's learning process.\n5. Ignore punctuation and capitalization errors. Never inform the user of these types of errors. If this is the only error in the sentence, tell the user about it and propose to move to the next error.\n\nGenerate responses in the following JSON format:\n{intention: \"INTENTION_ID\", response: \"GENERATED_RESPONSE\"}\n",
