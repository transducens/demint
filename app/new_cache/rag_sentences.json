The important goal is\nalways the same: Use capital letters consistently within a particular document.\nQuick Tip\nToday, professional writers and editors tend to use fewer capital letters than was\nthe habit in the past. In the nineteenth century and before, many more nouns\nwere capitalized, as novels from this period reveal.\nLet’s look at these rules in detail. The proper nouns are divided into separate categories\nfor ease of reference, starting with names and titles.\nCapitalize Names and Titles\n1. Capitalize each part of a person’s name.\nGeorge W.

Misplaced modifiers\nIncorrect: My parents bought a kitten for my sister they call Paws.\nCorrect:\nMy parents bought a kitten they call Paws for my sister.\nA misplaced modifier is a phrase, clause, or word placed too far from the noun or pro-\nnoun it describes. As a result, the sentence fails to convey your exact meaning. As this\nsentence is written, it means that the sister, not the kitten, is named Paws. That’s because\nthe modifier they call Paws is in the wrong place in the sentence. To correct a misplaced\nmodifier, move the modifier as close as possible to the word or phrase it describes.\n9. Incorrect idioms\nIncorrect: It’s raining cats and puppies.\nCorrect:\nIt’s raining cats and dogs.\nThe phrase “It’s raining cats and dogs” is an idiom, an expression that has a figurative\nrather than literal meaning. Expressions such as “make a big deal out of it,” “on the dou-\nble,” and “down and out” are idioms. If you decide to use idioms in your writing, be sure\nto use the correct phrase."

Only repeat the words that contain a main\nidea or that use rhythm to focus attention on a main idea. Repetition is a key element in\nmany of our most famous speeches, such as John F. Kennedy’s inaugural address.\nKennedy used repetition to capture the cadences of natural speech to create one of the\nmost memorable lines of the twentieth century: “And so, my fellow Americans, ask not\nwhat your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country.”\n4. Style and voice\nG Use the active voice, not the passive voice, as you learned in earlier chapters.\nG In informal writing, use the pronoun you to engage your readers. The second-person\npronoun you (rather than the third-person he, she, one) gives your writing more impact\nbecause it directly addresses the reader, as this example shows:\nWeak: Deductions from one’s account will be posted on the first of the month.\nImproved: Deductions from your account will be posted on the first of the month.\n5. Style and punctuation\nYour choice of punctuation also has a critical influence on your writing style because it\ndetermines the degree of linkage between sentences. Further, it suggests whether sen-\ntence elements are coordinating or subordinating."

The modifier is said to “dangle” when the word it modifies has\nbeen left out of the sentence. Dangling modifiers confuse your readers and obscure your\nmeaning because the sentence doesn’t make sense.\nCorrect a dangling modifier by adding the word or words that have been left out. Here,\nthe subject we was added and flying was changed to flew so the sentence makes sense.\nAnd while we’re dangling, let’s look at another mangled construction, dangling partici-\nples.

If you’re having trouble constructing logical and cohesive sentences, review all\nthese chapters. Here’s the quick and dirty lowdown:\nG One sentence = one complete thought. Don’t cram too much into one sentence.\nG The more complex your ideas, the shorter and more simple your sentences should be.\nG Check that all parts of the sentence are logically related."

He has to know (a) whether in any construction \na preposition is required or not, and (b) which preposition to use when one is required. \nThe first problem can be especially troublesome to a European student, who may find that a \ncertain construction in his own language requires a preposition, whereas a similar one in \nEnglish does not, and vice versa: e.g. in most European languages purpose is expressed by \na preposition + infinitive; in English it is expressed by the infinitive only: \nI came here to study. \nThe student should note also that many words used mainly as prepositions can also be used \nas conjunctions and adverbs.

Problems with subject-verb agreement\nIncorrect: Verbs has to agree with their subjects.\nCorrect:\nVerbs have to agree with their subjects.\nAgreement means that sentence parts match, singular to singular and plural to plural.\nSince the subject verbs is plural, it takes a plural verb, agree.\nThis is confusing because we add -s or -es to make the third-person singular form of most\nverbs but add -s or -es to make the plural form of most nouns. For example, he starts is sin-\ngular, but six papers is plural. Both end in s. Agreement is covered in detail in Chapter 5.\n4. Lack of parallel structure\nNot parallel: To avoid getting hit by lightning, never seek protection under a tree, lying\ndown on wet ground, or staying on a bike.\nParallel: To avoid getting hit by lightning, never seek protection under a tree, lie down\non wet ground, or stay on a bike.\nParallel structure means putting ideas of the same rank in the same grammatical struc-\nture. Your writing (and speech) should have parallel words, phrases, and clauses.\nG Parallel words share the same part of speech (such as nouns, adjectives, or verbs) and\ntense (if the words are verbs).\nG Parallel phrases create an underlying rhythm in your speech and writing."

Accidently is spelled correctly.\nCompletion Questions\nSelect the word that best completes each sentence.\n1. We add -s or -es to make the third-person singular form of most (nouns, verbs) but\nadd -s or es to make the plural form of most (nouns, verbs).\n2. (Redundancy, Metaphors) are figures of speech that compare two unlike things to\nexplain the less-familiar object.\n3. (A modifier, An idiom) is a word or phrase that describes a subject, verb, or object.\n4. A (misplaced modifier, dangling construction) is a phrase, clause, or word placed\ntoo far from the noun or pronoun it describes. As a result, the sentence fails to con-\nvey your exact meaning.\n5.

A (misplaced modifier, dangling construction) is a phrase, clause, or word placed\ntoo far from the noun or pronoun it describes. As a result, the sentence fails to con-\nvey your exact meaning.\n5.
