"[0:06:21.057875-->0:06:47.564875] SPEAKER_01|| how important is it to make long term plans i think in personal life it's quite important to make long term plans because you are able to know what you want to become the way you are old and what you want to earn for money and what you want to do for the community for your country ", "[0:06:47.564875-->0:06:59.516875] SPEAKER_01|| i think in in in

work school it's really for yourself important to know what you want to do after school so you can have a good grades in certain subjects so that you will be able to show other people after school that you ", "[0:07:27.421937-->0:07:50.365937] SPEAKER_01|| like the things that you're good in government it is of course very important to make long term plans if we look at the whole euro crisis

"[0:08:18.423000-->0:08:21.055000] SPEAKER_00|| why do some people prefer not to plan ahead?", "[0:08:21.055000-->0:08:46.385000] SPEAKER_02|| while some people want to be spontaneous and i also think that's actually quite good idea to someone to say let's pack a suitcase with let's say a bikini and some trousers and then let's go to the airport and just pick one flight wherever it takes us so i think this also quite good but i think when it comes to important things like planning a family it's very important that you plan ahead to have a good job so you are financially stable ", "[0:08:46.385000-->0:08:51.245000] SPEAKER_02|| so it depends you cannot always be a spesentaniously spesentaneous", "[0:08:51.245000-->0:08:51.279000] SPEAKER_02||  1 minuten.", "[0:08:51.279000-->0:08:51.785062] SPEAKER_00||  what do you think?", "[0:08:51.785062-->0:09:03.007062] SPEAKER_01|| i think it's for most people just laziness not to make long term plans i think they don't want to think about it and that's the reason they don't think about it", "[0:09:03.007062-->0:09:03.294125] SPEAKER_00||  Husserlund", "[0:09:03.294125-->0:09:07.462188] SPEAKER_00||  thank you now i think it's your turn to be given the question", "[0:09:07.462188-->0:09:08.508250] SPEAKER_00|| here's your card", "[0:09:08.508250-->0:09:09.892250] SPEAKER_00|| present dot co card", "[0:09:09.892250-->0:09:15.984312] SPEAKER_00|| remember anique you have about 2 minutes to tell us what you think and there are some ideas on the card for you to use if you like ", "[0:09:15.984312-->0:09:17.098375] SPEAKER_02||  all right here we go", "[0:09:17.098375-->0:09:34.434375] SPEAKER_02|| what practice will influence how cities develop in the future that's a very good question because i think because the rising population nowadays that's very important right now to think about the future so um when it comes to population we can definitely", "[0:09:34.434375-->0:09:47.794375] SPEAKER_02|| see that there is going to be more people in one city so probably they have to build more houses higher houses build more skyscrapers people are going to live in much smaller spaces ", "[0:09:47.794375-->0:10:06.584375] SPEAKER_02|| and also i think the living standard is going to get a bit down because you probably won't be able to have a garden and your own house will just share a small flat probably in the big cities also you have to deforest forests in order to make space for buildings ", "[0:10:06.584375-->0:10:20.902375] SPEAKER_02|| so i think the cities are just going to get more packed with buildings and the nature or the sceneries are going to suffer from that and financially well ", "[0:10:20.902375-->0:10:49.725375] SPEAKER_02|| they could develop in different ways i think everything is getting more expensive everyday because the resources are getting rarer rarer and yeah i think also the price of water is going to raise and energy and the fuel obviously and yeah just like things like petrol and climate well we are experiencing global climate changes global warming ", "[0:10:49.725375-->0:11:17.822437] SPEAKER_02|| but i think not every city is affected so far so probably in the jungles or like rainforest the seasons are not really going to change because they are always at the equator but other cities like not every cities but let's say the antarctica i think all the ice jobs are going to melt at some point and then just the animals are going to suffer and also people there ", "[0:11:17.822437-->0:11:18.311500] SPEAKER_00||  thank you", "[0:11:18.311500-->0:11:21.939563] SPEAKER_00|| is it important to preserve old buildings in cities ", "[0:11:21.939563-->0:11:49.496563] SPEAKER_01|| i think so because if you want to to have the old scenery that that we had in the early days many many people used to are are usually looking looking back to to the good life many old people and i think it's it's really good to to preserve those buildings to to have the the old scenery in the cities ", "[0:11:49.496563-->0:11:50.070625] SPEAKER_00||  what do you think?", "[0:11:50.070625-->0:12:15.568688] SPEAKER_02|| i agree but i also think that they're a very important part of the culture of the city so let's look at england i think it's if i think of england i always think automatically of red brick buildings and very charming small houses so if we wouldn't have them in a few years anymore i don't think england would have any charm left so it's all about the flair and i think you really should preserve them", "[0:12:15.568688-->0:12:15.805750] SPEAKER_00||  \u0421\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0431\u043e.", "[0:12:15.805750-->0:12:19.433750] SPEAKER_00|| now to finish the test we're going to talk about the future in general", "[0:12:19.433750-->0:12:22.319813] SPEAKER_00|| do you think newspapers and books have a future?", "[0:12:22.319813-->0:12:23.366813] SPEAKER_02|| yes i think so", "[0:12:23.366813-->0:12:42.148813] SPEAKER_02|| some people say that the internet is going to take over everything and that you're going to read all the articles now on ipads on ebooklets what are they called? kindle exactly but i think it's still nice to have an actual newspaper in your hands a physical one that you can touch and just also the smell of the paper so ", "[0:12:42.148813-->0:12:43.194875] SPEAKER_01||  Kondukta", "[0:12:43.194875-->0:12:43.295875] SPEAKER_01||  .", "[0:12:43.295875-->0:12:43.734938] SPEAKER_01|| exactly", "[0:12:43.734938-->0:13:05.302000] SPEAKER_01|| and i think the sound of flipping a page is so good and most people don't like it to to to read from from a screen because their eyes get tired but i think it's it's much better to to read from a paper it's it's more quiet more just relaxing for your eyes", "[0:13:05.302000-->0:13:05.758063] SPEAKER_02||  yeah", "[0:13:05.758063-->0:13:07.040063] SPEAKER_02||  Arbite,  have a scoose.", "[0:13:07.040063-->0:13:07.343125] SPEAKER_00||  .", "[0:13:07.343125-->0:13:11.157188] SPEAKER_00|| given the choice would you rather live in the past or in the future ", "[0:13:11.157188-->0:13:18.215188] SPEAKER_01|| um i think i would rather live in the past because because it's it's it's much more", "[0:13:18.215188-->0:13:43.726188] SPEAKER_01|| better life i think less worried and and there were we there are so many issues there they're complaining about and and all people all everybody is is just thinking about problems that are not real real problems in my view and i think in the early days they they didn't have the time to worry about those problems i think i would rather live in the past ", "[0:13:43.726188-->0:14:03.865188] SPEAKER_02|| i also think it's very tempting to live let's say in the roman times because they have like a lot of feasts and yeah it's just also the foods enjoying the foods going to not the parties but all the celebrations there i really think that it's going to be not easier to live there because you don't have all the technology of course", "[0:14:03.865188-->0:14:15.485188] SPEAKER_02|| but as he pointed out i think that nowadays we worry about too many small things and back then it was just war or not war and starve or not starve and the diseases they had back then ", "[0:14:15.485188-->0:14:15.822250] SPEAKER_01||  \u0430", "[0:14:15.822250-->0:14:21.660313] SPEAKER_02|| okay because now we have the medical advantages so we don't
